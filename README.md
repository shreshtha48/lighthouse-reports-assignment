 # Livestock analysis

 This repository contains the code used to create visualizations for the final stage of the Lighthouse reports data fellowship program wrapped up as an R package. The data here consists of livestock registery obtained from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_lZ9B8Ns2nXLQCfzeoNGHbxslwkedUsw/view)

The data has information about the types of the farm, their location, their operating status, the type of species they have in the farm, the nitrogen emission by the farm etc. More metadata about the columns can be found [here](https://agricultura.gencat.cat/ca/serveis/registres-oficials/ramaderia-sanitat-animal/registre-explotacions-ramaderes/)
